        You find yourself slowly and painfully emerging from a deep slumber, the very air you breathe
        heavy with the weight of forgotten dreams. As consciousness reluctantly reclaims its grip,
        a haze lifts, and the world swims into focus, revealing your own figure in a dimly lit space.

        Slowly, awareness seeps in, a dull ache pervading every limb.

        You become tired of your stupid life, everything looks so much of nothing to you.
        You loose interest in seeking the way home or in anything else you could do at the moment.
        You crash your head on the first spiked object you find.
        
        You die.
